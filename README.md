<h1>Etch-A-Sketch</h1>
<p>This is a sketching app being created as part of the Odin Project course</p>
<h2>Progress and reflection</h2>
<p>I am pleased with how this has gone so far - the product functions as it should and is able to change when the user requests</p>
<p>It will sometimes not quite load right (currently unknown why) but page refresh will fix this.</p>
<p>I suspect I will return to this in the future to implement the two suggested changes from the Odin Project extions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.</li>
  <uL>
    <li>Note - this is mainly a put-off for me becuase I work in hex colours, and currently will do it when I decide to remind myself how to do RGB colours</li>
  </uL>
  <li>Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm not quite sure what they mean by this - so may look at inspiration from other solutions to then improve/implement into my own</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>As well as this, I no doubt will update the somewhat minimalist current styling to make it look a tad more visually appealing</p>
